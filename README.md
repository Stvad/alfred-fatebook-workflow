# alfred-fatebook-workflow
[Fatebook.io](https://fatebook.io/) workflow for [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/).

Type forecast to register a new Fatebook prediction.

Make sure to configure the workflow by [adding your api key](https://fatebook.io/api-setup), then you can just type forecast, and it should be pretty straightforward.
